- The client that I worked with was a consulting company design to develop individualized finacial plans. Whether it was for retirement, savings, investtments or insurance, that is the type of service they provided. TThe issue thatt they wantted me to solve was to look for any type of vunerabilites in there software so that there employees and clients information wouldn't leak.
- What I believe I did particularly well was identifying the soruce of the vulnerabilites as well as trying to figure out a solution to fix it. The reason why it is important tto code securly because hackers could exploit your code and inject there own.
